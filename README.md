# CircuitAnalysisLabHelper
C++ Program that is designed to aid in the completion of a circuit analysis lab. After collecting data from the user the program will solve for resistance of the apparatus, experimental decibel gain and experimental decibal gain. Lastly the program will display the values of the tested frequency, input voltage, output voltage, theoretical decibel gain and experimental decibel gain in a neat table that will also be exported to a save file named doublearray.txt. This project was made as the final project for Dutchess Community College's course: "Introduction to Computer Science for Engineers".
